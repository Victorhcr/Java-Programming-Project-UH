March, 12: 14:00 - 18:00 (Set up GitHub and Project Files)
March, 19: 15:00 - 19:00 (Connect to The New York Times API, get data from API, retrieve data received and created chart using JAVAFX)
March, 20: 14:30 - 16:00 (Tried to find a way of creating a chart using a separate class, and not the main class - Not successful)
March 21-27: ~ (The chart now works in a separate class and the there is a prediction of the data. The cobertura tests cover more than 50%, as requested. Still need to do some code cleanning)
March 28-4: ~ (Created a GUI where the user can type a word, choose the range of years he wants to see - max of 25 years - and then call the JAVAFX chart to plot the data received. I don't know how to make the user call a chart more than once without crashing the program. My solution is to disable the "Search" option and just show the chart once. If the user wants to get the data of other words, he needs to run the program again. I still need to find a way of reducing the length of the View method).
